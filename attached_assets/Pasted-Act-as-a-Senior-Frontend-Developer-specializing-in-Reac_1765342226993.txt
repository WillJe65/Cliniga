Act as a Senior Frontend Developer specializing in React.js and Tailwind CSS.

I need you to build the frontend architecture and key components for a clinic appointment website named "Cliniga".

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:

    Frontend ONLY: Do NOT write any backend logic, Node.js code, or SQL queries.

    Mock Data: Since there is no backend yet, you must simulate all data fetching using local mock JSON data and simulate authentication using React Context and LocalStorage to store a dummy user token and role.

    Styling: Use Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, professional medical aesthetic (e.g., trustworthy blues, clean whites). Ensure it is fully responsive.

Project Scope & Features (based on attachment):

The application needs to handle two distinct user roles: 'Patient' and 'Doctor'. The UI must adapt dynamically based on the logged-in role.

Required Pages & Routes Structure:

    Public/Guest Routes:

        / (Landing Page): Welcome message and navigation.

        /login: A form allowing selection of role (Doctor/Patient) for simulated login.

        /register: Basic registration form.

        /doctors: A public list view of doctors showing their name, specialization, and practice schedule (mock data).

    Private/Protected Routes (Require Authentication):

        /dashboard: The main landing page after login. Content varies drastically by role (see below).

Role-Based Logic & Components:

A. If Logged in as PATIENT:

    Navbar: Should show links to "Dashboard", "Book Appointment", and "Logout".

    Dashboard View (/dashboard): Should display a section for "Upcoming Appointments" and another for "Appointment History".

    Booking Feature (/book-appointment): A form/wizard to select a Doctor from a list, pick a date/time, and submit a booking (simulate the submission to console log and update mock state).

B. If Logged in as DOCTOR:

    Navbar: Should show links to "Dashboard (Schedule)" and "Logout".

    Dashboard View (/dashboard): Should display "Today's Appointments" list.

    Appointment Details & Records: When a doctor clicks an appointment in their list, it should open a modal or a details page where they can view patient info and, crucially, add Medical Records (Diagnosis and Notes inputs) for that specific appointment.

Deliverables:

    Project Structure: A suggested folder structure for the React project (e.g., /src/components, /src/pages, /src/context, /src/data).

    Mock Data Sample (/src/data/mockData.js): Provide sample JSON arrays based on the attachment's schema guideline for:

        doctors (id, name, specialization, schedule string)

        appointments (id, patientName, doctorName, date, time, status)

    Core Component Examples: Please write the full React component code + Tailwind classes for:

        The Role-Based Dashboard page component (how you switch between patient view vs doctor view).

        A styled Appointment Card component (used in lists to show appointment info, date, time, and status badge).
